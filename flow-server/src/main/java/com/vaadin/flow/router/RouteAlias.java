/**
 * Defines the route alias for components that function as navigation targets in
 * routing.
 * <p>
 * The route alias allows declaring several route paths in addition to the path
 * declared by the {@link Route} annotation. The component has to have at least
 * one {@literal @Route} annotation which is considered as a primary route and
 * its route path will be used if {@link RouteConfiguration#getUrl(Class)} is
 * called. Thus {@code @RouteAlias} route path is used only to resolve the
 * component during navigation.
 * <p>
 * The route template of the navigation target is composed of the values of
 * all {@link RoutePrefix} annotated on the {@link #layout()} and
 * {@link ParentLayout} class values, starting from the root parent and joined
 * together using slash delimiter to form a path form string.
 * <p>
 * This annotation can be used multiple times on the same class.
