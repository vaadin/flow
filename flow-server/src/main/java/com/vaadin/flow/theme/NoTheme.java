/**
 * A marker annotation to avoid applying any default theme to the application.
 *
 * <p>
 * Flow uses the following logic to determine which theme to use for the
 * application:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If a {@link Theme} annotation is found on the AppShellConfigurator, the
 * theme defined by it is used.
 * <li>If a {@link NoTheme} annotation is found on the AppShellConfigurator,
 * theming is disabled.
 * <li>If the <code>com.vaadin.flow.theme.lumo.Lumo</code> class is available in
 * the classpath (which comes from the vaadin-lumo-theme project), then it is
 * used as the default theme.
 * </ul>
