/**
 * SPI for customizing lookup in applications inside Servlet 5.0 containers.
 * <p>
 * There are two ways of customizing Lookup in various servlet containers:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Use {@link AbstractLookupInitializer} SPI via providing an implementation
 * for the framework which doesn't prevent
 * {@link LookupServletContainerInitializer} execution.
 * <li>Completely disable {@link LookupServletContainerInitializer} and
 * implement own way to set up {@link Lookup} and make it available via
 * {@link VaadinContext#getAttribute(Class)}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The first case allows to customize {@link Lookup} creation and initialization
 * in case when it's not possible to prevent
 * {@link LookupServletContainerInitializer} execution (any container which
 * completely supports Servlet 5.0 specification). In this case it's possible to
 * implement {@link AbstractLookupInitializer} for the framework.
 * <p>
 * The second case is only possible when a servlet container doesn't run
 * {@link ServletContainerInitializer}s out of the box (e.g. OSGi or Spring boot
 * executed as a Jar) at all. Otherwise you may not disable an existing
 * {@link ServletContainerInitializer} and it will be executed anyway.
 * <p>
 * This is SPI for {@link Lookup} SPI. The difference is:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Lookup} allows to override services per Web application (by the
 * application developer). For some service interfaces there can be several
 * implementations available in {@link Lookup}.
 * <li>{@link AbstractLookupInitializer} allows to override how the
 * {@link Lookup} works per framework. The default implementation available if
 * no framework is used. Only one service implementation (excluding the default
 * one) may be available in the web application classpath and it's provided by
 * the developers for the framework support (the main usecase here is Spring
 * add-on).
 * </ul>
