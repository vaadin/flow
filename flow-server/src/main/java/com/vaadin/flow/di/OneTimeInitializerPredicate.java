/**
 * The presence of the service implementing this interface with
 * {@link #runOnce()} returning {@code true} means that
 * {@link jakarta.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer}s are executed only once
 * and the implementation doesn't have to care about cleaning up data collected
 * based on previous call.
 * <p>
 * In some cases (e.g. OSGi) the
 * {@link jakarta.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer#onStartup(java.util.Set, jakarta.servlet.ServletContext)}
 * method may be called several times for the application (with different
 * classes provided). In this case the initializer logic should reset the data
 * passed on the previous call and set the new data. To be able to reset the
 * data correctly the {@link jakarta.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer}
 * implementation may need to store additional data between calls which is
 * excessive if the
 * {@link jakarta.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer#onStartup(java.util.Set, jakarta.servlet.ServletContext)}
 * is executed only once.
