/**
 * Provides a way to discover services used by Flow (SPI).
 * <p>
 * A lookup instance may be created based on a service, see
 * {@link #of(Object, Class...)}. Several lookup instances may be combined via
 * {@link #compose(Lookup, Lookup)} method which allows to make a lookup
 * instance based on a number of services. The resulting lookup instance may be
 * used in internal Flow code to transfer data in the unified way which allows
 * to change the available data types during the code evolution without changing
 * the internal API (like arguments in methods and constructors).
 * <p>
 * There is the "global" application {@link Lookup} instance and the
 * {@link VaadinContext}. It has one to one mapping and is available even before
 * a {@link DeploymentConfiguration} (and {@link VaadinServlet}) is created. So
 * this is kind of a singleton for a Web Application. As a consequence it
 * provides and may return only web app singleton services. Dependency injection
 * frameworks can provide an implementation for the application {@code Lookup}
 * which manages instances according to the conventions of that framework.
 * <p>
 * The application {@code Lookup} is similar to the {@link Instantiator} class
 * but a {@link Lookup} instance is available even before a
 * {@link VaadinService} instance is created (and as a consequence there is no
 * yet an {@link Instantiator} instance).
 * <p>
 * This is the code which one may use to get the application {@link Lookup}
 * instance:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 *     VaadinContext context = ...;
 *     Lookup lookup = context.getAttribute(Lookup.class);
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This SPI is mostly for internal framework usage since {@link Instantiator}
 * provides all required services for the application developer.
 *
