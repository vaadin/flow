/**
 * Provides a way to discover services used by Flow (SPI). Dependency injection
 * frameworks can provide an implementation that manages instances according to
 * the conventions of that framework.
 * <p>
 * This is similar to the {@link Instantiator} class but a {@link Lookup}
 * instance is available even before a {@link VaadinService} instance is created
 * (and as a consequence there is no yet an {@link Instantiator} instance).
 * <p>
 * The {@link Lookup} instance and the {@link VaadinContext} has one to one
 * mapping and is available even before a {@link DeploymentConfiguration} ( and
 * {@link VaadinServlet}) is created. So this is kind of a singleton for a Web
 * Application. As a consequence it provides and may return only web app
 * singleton services.
 * <p>
 * This is the code which one may use to get the {@link Lookup} instance:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 *     VaadinContext context = ...;
 *     Lookup lookup = context.getAttribute(Lookup.class);
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This SPI is mostly for internal framework usage since {@link Instantiator}
 * provides all required services for the application developer.
