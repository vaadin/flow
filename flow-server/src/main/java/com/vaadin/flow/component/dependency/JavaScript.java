/**
 * Defines JavaScript dependencies on a {@link Component} class. For adding
 * multiple JavaScript files for a single component, you can use this annotation
 * multiple times.
 * <p>
 * It is guaranteed that dependencies will be loaded only once. The files loaded
 * will be in the same order as the annotations were on the class. However,
 * loading order is only guaranteed on a class level; Annotations from different
 * classes may appear in different order, grouped by the annotated class. Also,
 * files identified by {@code @JavaScript} will be loaded after
 * {@link com.vaadin.flow.component.dependency.JsModule} and before
 * {@link com.vaadin.flow.component.dependency.CssImport}.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: Currently all frontend resources are bundled together into one big
 * bundle. This means, that JavaScript files loaded by one class will be present
 * on a view constructed by another class. For example, if there are two classes
 * {@code RootRoute} annotated with {@code @Route("")}, and another class
 * {@code RouteA} annotated with {@code @Route("route-a")} and
 * {@code @JavaScript("./src/javascript.js")}, the {@code javascript.js} will be
 * run on the root route as well.
 * <p>
 * External JavaScript dependencies (e.g. "http://example.com/some.js") are
 * added in the same way as {@link Page#addJavaScript(String)} and the result is
 * just adding a classic {@code javscript} element to the page. Other paths used
 * in the {@link JavaScript#value()} method are considered as relative to
 * {@code frontend} directory and they are added to the page as a JavaScript
 * module (a {@code javscript} element with {@code type="module"}). In this case
 * a {@link JavaScript} annotation behaves exactly as a {@link JsModule}
 * annotation.
 * <p>
 * It's not possible to execute a function defined in JavaScript module via
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * <code>
 * UI.getCurrent().getPage().executeJs("some_function_definied_in_module()");
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * because the function is private there (unless it's explicitly exposed). The
 * JavaScript where the function is defined should be either external or it
 * should be added using {@link Page#addJavaScript(String)}: in this case all
 * declared functions become available in the global scope.
