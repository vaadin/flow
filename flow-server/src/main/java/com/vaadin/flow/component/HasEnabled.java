/**
 * A generic interface for components and other user interface objects that may

 * <p>
 * Element may be implicitly or explicitly disabled.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Element is explicitly disabled if it's disabled via the
 * {@code setEnabled(false)} call.
 * <li>Element is implicitly disabled if it has an ascendant which is explicitly
 * disabled.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Element is enabled if it's not explicitly disabled and there is no disabled
 * ascendant.
 * <p>
 * An implicitly disabled element becomes enabled automatically if its disabled
 * ascendant becomes enabled.
 * <p>
 * Element may be explicitly disabled being in a disabled parent. Such element
 * remains disabled when its parent becomes enabled.
 * <p>
 * Note that an element may change its enabled state if it's inside disabled
 * parent and it becomes detached from it. In this case if it has not been
 * explicitly disabled then it becomes enabled until it's attached. If the new
 * parent is enabled then the element remains enabled. Otherwise it becomes
 * disabled again.
