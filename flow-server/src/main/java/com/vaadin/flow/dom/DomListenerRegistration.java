     * <dl>
     * <dt>DebouncePhase.TRAILING</dt>
     * <dd>The server side is notified once after the event hasn't been

     * fired if a person continuously types without pauses longer than the
     * timeout. This is the most commonly used mode. There is
     * {@link #debounce(int)} shorthand for this mode.</dd>
     * <dt>DebouncePhase.LEADING</dt>
     * <dd>In this case you only get notified of this event once right away on
     * the server side. Other events of the same type will be ignored until the
     * timeout has passed.</dd>
     * <dt>DebouncePhase.LEADING + DebouncePhase.TRAILING</dt>
     * <dd>This works like with the basic DebouncePhase.TRAILING, but in
     * addition the first event of the burst gets reported rightaway. This is
     * good if your want normal debouncing, but you are also interested to know
     * if the user input has started.</dd>
     * <dt>DebouncePhase.TIMEOUT</dt>
     * <dd>In this case the listener is triggered only after the given timeout.
     * If there are multiple events during that period, only the last one is
     * reported.</dd>
     * <dt>DebouncePhase.LEADING + DebouncePhase.TIMEOUT</dt>
     * <dd>In this case the listener is triggered when an event burst starts,
     * but afterwards only after the given timeout has passed. There is
     * {@link #throttle(int)} shorthand for this mode.</dd>
     * </dl>
     * <p>
     * In case another event in the UI triggers a "server roundtrip" from the
     * client-side, events possibly queued by the debouncer are fired before
     * that. Thus, events may occur before than expected. Also in the otherway
     * around, due to the client-server nature of the web apps, events may
     * arrive bit late. Do not expect debouncing to be perfectly deterministic!
     * <p>
     * Also note that due to the client-side implementation, de-bounce settings
     * are global for keys formed of "element-to-event-type-to-timeout".
     * Behavior is unspecified if you configure multiple debouncing rules for
     * the same event on the same element.
