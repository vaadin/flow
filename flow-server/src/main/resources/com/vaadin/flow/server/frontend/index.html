This file is auto-generated by Vaadin.
If you want to customize the index.html, you can copy this file or create your
own `index.html` in your frontend directory.
By default, the `index.html` file should be in `./frontend/` folder.

NOTE: you need to restart the dev-server after adding the new `index.html` file.
After that, all modifications to `index.html` are recompiled automatically.
