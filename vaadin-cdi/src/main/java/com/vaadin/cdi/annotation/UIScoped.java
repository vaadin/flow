/**
 * The lifecycle of a UIScoped component is bound to a browser tab.
 * <p>
 * Injection with this annotation will create a direct reference to the object
 * rather than a proxy.
 * <p>
 * There are some limitations when not using proxies. Circular referencing (that
 * is, injecting A to B and B to A) will not work. Injecting into a larger scope
 * will bind the instance from the currently active smaller scope, and will
 * ignore smaller scope change. For example after being injected into session
 * scope it will point to the same {@link UIScoped} bean instance ( even its
 * {@link UI} is closed ) regardless of {@link UI} change.
 * <p>
 * The sister annotation to this is the {@link NormalUIScoped}. Both annotations
 * reference the same underlying scope, so it is possible to get both a proxy
 * and a direct reference to the same object by using different annotations.
