= Binding Model Data in a Template

At the core of `Template` is the way model values are bound to different parts of the element tree defined by the template.
To get started with using templates and learn how to set model values, see <<tutorial-template-basic#,Creating A Simple Component Using the Template API>>.

== Binding Text Content

The value of a model property can be used as the text content of an element using `{{propertyName}}` inside a tag.

[source,html]
----
<div>
  Hello, <span class="greeting-name">{{name}}</span>
</div>
----

== Binding Property Values

You can set an element property value based on a model by using the special `[propertyName]="binding"` syntax.
The next example creates an image link where the `linkTarget` property from the model us used as the link target and the `image` property is used as the image URL.

[source,html]
----
<a [href]="linkTarget">
  <img [src]="image">
</a>
----

[WARNING]
`[name]="binding"` defines that the element _property_ named `name` should get it's value from the model property named `binding`, whereas `name="binding"` (i.e. without brackets) defines that the element _attribute_ named `name` should have the value `binding` regardless of any value in the model.

== Binding Attribute Values

A binding written as `<div [something]="model"></div>` is bound to the _property_ `something` because the property can typically be changed on the fly while the attribute is often used only for the initial value.

When you what to explicitly bind to an attribute, you prefix the name with `attr.`, i.e. write `<div [attr.something]="model"></div>` to bind to the _attribute_ `something`.

[NOTE]
Many elements require you to use the property instead of the attribute to be able to update the value. It is usually best to use the property binding `[something]` unless the element specifically defines that you must use an attribute.

== Binding Class Names

There is special support for binding class names in a template, see <<tutorial-template-class-name-binding#,Binding Class Names in a Template>>.
