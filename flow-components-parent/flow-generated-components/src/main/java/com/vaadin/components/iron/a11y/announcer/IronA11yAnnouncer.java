/**
 * Description copied from corresponding location in WebComponent:
 * 
 * {@code iron-a11y-announcer} is a singleton element that is intended to add
 * a11y to features that require on-demand announcement from screen readers. In
 * order to make use of the announcer, it is best to request its availability in
 * the announcing element.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Polymer({
 * 
 * is: 'x-chatty',
 * 
 * attached: function() { // This will create the singleton element if it has
 * not // been created yet: Polymer.IronA11yAnnouncer.requestAvailability(); }
 * });
 * 
 * After the {@code iron-a11y-announcer} has been made available, elements can
 * make announces by firing bubbling {@code iron-announce} events.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * this.fire('iron-announce', { text: 'This is an announcement!' }, { bubbles:
 * true });
 * 
 * Note: announcements are only audible if you have a screen reader enabled.
