/**
 * Description copied from corresponding location in WebComponent:
 * 
 * The {@code iron-iconset-svg} element allows users to define their own icon
 * sets that contain svg icons. The svg icon elements should be children of the
 * {@code iron-iconset-svg} element. Multiple icons should be given distinct
 * id's.
 * 
 * Using svg elements to create icons has a few advantages over traditional
 * bitmap graphics like jpg or png. Icons that use svg are vector based so they
 * are resolution independent and should look good on any device. They are
 * stylable via css. Icons can be themed, colorized, and even animated.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * <iron-iconset-svg name="my-svg-icons" size="24"> <svg> <defs> <g id="shape">
 * <rect x="12" y="0" width="12" height="24" /> <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="12"
 * /> </g> </defs> </svg> </iron-iconset-svg>
 * 
 * This will automatically register the icon set "my-svg-icons" to the iconset
 * database. To use these icons from within another element, make a
 * {@code iron-iconset} element and call the {@code byId} method to retrieve a
 * given iconset. To apply a particular icon inside an element use the
 * {@code applyIcon} method. For example:
 * 
 * iconset.applyIcon(iconNode, 'car');
