  "description": "The `<iron-flex-layout>` component provides simple ways to use\n[CSS flexible box layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes),\nalso known as flexbox. This component provides two different ways to use flexbox:\n\n1. [Layout classes](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/iron-flex-layout-classes.html).\nThe layout class stylesheet provides a simple set of class-based flexbox rules, that\nlet you specify layout properties directly in markup. You must include this file\nin every element that needs to use them.\n\n    Sample use:\n\n    ```\n    <custom-element-demo>\n      <template>\n        <script src=\"../webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.js\"></script>\n        <next-code-block></next-code-block>\n      </template>\n    </custom-element-demo>\n    ```\n\n    ```html\n    <link rel=\"import\" href=\"iron-flex-layout-classes.html\">\n    <style is=\"custom-style\" include=\"iron-flex iron-flex-alignment\"></style>\n    <style>\n      .test { width: 100px; }\n    </style>\n    <div class=\"layout horizontal center-center\">\n      <div class=\"test\">horizontal layout center alignment</div>\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n2. [Custom CSS mixins](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/blob/master/iron-flex-layout.html).\nThe mixin stylesheet includes custom CSS mixins that can be applied inside a CSS rule using the `@apply` function.\n\nPlease note that the old [/deep/ layout classes](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/classes)\nare deprecated, and should not be used. To continue using layout properties\ndirectly in markup, please switch to using the new `dom-module`-based\n[layout classes](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/iron-flex-layout-classes.html).\nPlease note that the new version does not use `/deep/`, and therefore requires you\nto import the `dom-modules` in every element that needs to use them.\n\nA complete [guide](https://elements.polymer-project.org/guides/flex-layout) to `<iron-flex-layout>` is available."
