/**
 * The lifecycle of a {@link RouteScope @RouteScope} bean is controlled by route
 * navigation.
 * <p>
 * Every scoped bean belongs to one router component owner. It can be a
 * {@link Route @Route}, or a {@link RouterLayout}, or a
 * {@link HasErrorParameter HasErrorParameter}. Beans are qualified by
 * {@link RouteScopeOwner @RouteScopeOwner} to link with their owner.
 * <p>
 * As long as the owner component stays attached, all beans owned by it remain
 * in the scope.
 * <p>
 * Without the {@link RouteScopeOwner} annotation the owner is the current route
 * target component (dynamically calculated). With nested routing hierarchies,
 * the target is the "leaf" or "bottom most" routing component. The beans are
 * preserved as long as the owner component remains in the navigation chain. It
 * means that the bean may be preserved even if the navigation target is changed
 * (but the "initial" calculated owner is still in the navigation chain).
