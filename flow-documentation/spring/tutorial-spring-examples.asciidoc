= Getting Started with Spring and Flow

There is a tutorial application which shows the basic parts of a Spring Boot Application with Flow: https://github.com/vaadin/flow-spring-tutorial.
You can use this application example to test the different concepts and features presented in the documentation.

For starting a fresh project with Spring and Flow, you can take the https://github.com/vaadin/flow-spring-tutorial[Skeleton Starter for Flow and Spring].
It is a project template with the necessary parts there for starting building you own application.
This starter will later soon be available from https://vaadin.com/start, where you can customize the naming (package, project) for it.
