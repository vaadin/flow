== Router Layouts and Nested Router Targets

For a basic routing tutorial, see <<tutorial-routing-annotation#,Defining Routes with @Route>>.

When defining routes using `@Route("path")`, the component will by default be rendered inside the `<body>` tag on the page (the element returned by `HasElement.getElement()` is attached to the `<body>`). You can define a parent layout using the `Route.layout()` method. To render `CompanyComponent` inside a layout a layout you would call `MainLayout` you would do:

[source,java]
----
@Tag("div")
@Route(value="company", layout=MainLayout.class)
public class CompanyComponent extends Component {
}
----

All parent layouts must implement the `RouterLayout` interface. 

If there are multiple router target components using the same parent layout, then the parent layout instances will remain the same when the user navigates between the child components.
