= Defining Routes With @Route
The `@Route` annotation allows you to define an arbitrary component as a route target for a given URL fragment. For example:

[source,java]
----
@Route("")
public class HelloWorld extends Div {
  public HelloWorld() {
    setText("Hello world");
  }
}
----
This defines the `HelloWorld` component as the default route target for the application (empty route). You can define a separate component for a different route like this:

[source,java]
----
@Route("some/path")
public class SomePathComponent extends Div {
  public SomePathComponent() {
    setText("Hello @Route!");
  }
}
----

So whenever the user navigates to `http://yourdomain.com/some/path` (assuming the app is running from the root context), either by clicking on links inside the application or by typing the address directly on the address bar, the `SomePathComponent` component would be shown at the page.
