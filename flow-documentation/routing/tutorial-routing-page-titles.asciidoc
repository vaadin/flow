== Updating Page Title on Navigation

The simplest way to update the
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/title[Page Title] is
to use the `@Title` annotation on your `View` class.
[source,java]
----
@Title("home")
class HomeView extends Div implements View {

  HomeView(){
    setText("This is the home view");
  }
}
----
The `@Title` annotation is only read from the actually used view, parent views
are not considered.
