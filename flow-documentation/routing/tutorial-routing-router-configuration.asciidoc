== Defining Routes With RouterConfiguration
The _Routing API_ allows you to define a mapping between _URLs_ and _Views_ and handles navigation between _Views_ without page reloads. Routes are specified on a service (servlet) level, i.e. the configuration is shared between all users. You can define your own `RouterConfigurator` class which provides the configuration using the `@VaadinServletConfiguration` annotation.

[source,java]
----
@WebServlet(urlPatterns = "/*", name = "MyServlet", asyncSupported = true)
@VaadinServletConfiguration(routerConfigurator = MyRouterConfigurator.class, productionMode = false)
public static class MyServlet extends VaadinServlet {
}
----

Your `RouterConfigurator` class needs to override one method, where the actual configuration takes place. You cannot modify the configuration outside this method or store the configuration instance for later use. This is make sure that the configuration is thread safe.

[source,java]
----
@Override
public void configure(RouterConfiguration configuration) {
  configuration.setRoute("", HomeView.class);
  configuration.setRoute("company", CompanyView.class);
}
----

This will set up routing so that `HomeView` is used when the base URL (servlet path) is opened, e.g. `http://mysite.com/` and  `CompanyView` is used when `/company` is opened, e.g. using `http://mysite.com/company`.

[NOTE]
Do not start routes with a `/` as the URLs are relative to the servlet path.

All views must implement the `View` interface and override one method: `getElement()`. This method must return the root element of the view and cannot be changed while the view is visible. You can extend some existing component class which already has this method. The HomeView class could thus look like:
[source,java]
----
public class HomeView extends Div implements View {

    public HomeView() {
        setText("This is the home view");
    }

}
