= Getting Registered Routes

To retrieve all registered Routes in the application, you can use:

[source,java]
----
Router router = UI.getCurrent().getRouter().get();
List<RouteData> routes = router.getRoutes();
----

The `RouteData` object contains all relevant information about the defined route, such as URL, parameters and parent layout.

== Getting Registered Routes By Parent Layout

To get all the routes defined by parent layout, you can use instead:

[source,java]
----
Router router = UI.getCurrent().getRouter().get();
Map<Class<? extends RouterLayout>, List<RouteData>> routesByParent = router.getRoutesByParent();
List<RouteData> myRoutes = routesByParent.get(MyParentLayout.class);
----
