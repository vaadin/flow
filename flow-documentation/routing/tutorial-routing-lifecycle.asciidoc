= Navigation Lifecycle

During the navigation lifecycle the activating and deactivating components will get a number of different lifecycle state events.

== BeforeNavigationEvent

Any `Component` in the activating or deactivating navigation target chain will receive a `BeforeNavigationEvent` if they extend the `BeforeNavigationListener` *interface*.

This holds also true for listener implementation in a node component found from the root target e.g.
[source,java]
----
@Route("")
@Tag("main-layout")
@HtmlImport("frontend://com/example//MainLayout.html")
public class MainLayout extends PolymerTemplate<TemplateModel> {

    public MainLayout() {
        SideElement side = new SideElement();
        getElement().appendChild(side.getElement());
    }
}

public class SideElement extends Div implements BeforeNavigationListener {
    @Override
    public void beforeNavigation(BeforeNavigationEvent event) {
        // Handle for instance before navigation clean up
    }
}
----


==== Reroute
The `BeforeNavigationEvent` can be used to reroute dynamically if there is a need show completely different information in some state.
Rerouting can happen from a listener in the detaching or the attaching chain.

In this example the reroute would happen on attach of BlogList when it receives no results.
[source,java]
----
@Route("no-items")
public class NoItemsView extends Div {
  public NoItemsView() {
    setText("No items found.");
  }
}

@Route("blog")
public class BlogList extends Div implements BeforeNavigationListener {
  @Override
  public void beforeNavigation(BeforeNavigationEvent event) {
    // implementation omitted
    Object record = getItem();

    if (record == null) {
      event.rerouteTo(NoItemsView.class);
    }
  }

  private Object getItem() {
    // no-op implementation
    return null;
  }
}
----

== AfterNavigationEvent

A component can also listen to the `AfterNavigationEvent` that is sent when the
old state has been deactivated and the new state has been attached and configured.

A good use case for this event would be to update menu item selections and such, as now
there is no chance that some `Listener` would request a redirect so we can now trust that
this is the actual chain that we will have.

As with `BeforeNavigationEvent`, `AfterNavigationEvent` can be set to any `Component` in
the activating chain.

[source,java]
----
public class SideMenu extends Div implements AfterNavigationListener {
    Anchor blog = new Anchor("blog", "Blog");

    @Override
    public void afterNavigation(AfterNavigationEvent event) {
        boolean active = event.getLocation().getFirstSegment()
                .equals(blog.getHref());
        blog.getElement().getClassList().set("â‰¥active", active);
    }
}
