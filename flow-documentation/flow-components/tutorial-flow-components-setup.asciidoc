= Setup your project to use Flow components

Flow provides some pre-built server-side components for Vaadin webcomponents,
such as `Button`, `TextField` and so on. Those components are part of
the `flow-components` package, that can be added as an optional dependency to
any Flow project.

= Overview

`flow-components` package consists of two main sections:

* java api classes (`Button`, `TextField`, etc)
* web components' files (html, js, css etc)

All sections are used by Flow to display the components in web pages correctly.
By default, both sections are provided in the same jar.

Web components' files are provided as https://github.com/webjars/webjars/[webjars] â€“
jar files that contain webcomponents' files,
heavily influenced by current Polymer package manager: https://bower.io/[bower]
(not developed or maintained by Vaadin)

Webjars are designed to replace `bower` usage by using `Maven` for the same purposes.

`Flow` is able to resolve requests into webjars' contents (if intended by request),
imitating the regular web component's files.

Although currently enabled by default, webjars do not restrict users from using external
web components' files:

* webjar resolving can be turned off
* if no suitable webjar is found, request resolving falls back to configured
external web components' locations

[NOTE]
Due to current webjar https://github.com/webjars/webjars/issues[limitations],
extra maven configuration (extra repository + bom file declaration) is required.

== Maven configuration to use webjars

The first step is to add the `bom` and `flow-components` package to your project
dependencies. This package is released alongside Flow and shares the same
version number. When using Maven you can add it into your `pom.xml` as this:

[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <!-- Limitation: Not all webjars are synced into Maven Central now -->
        <id>webjars</id>
        <url>https://dl.bintray.com/webjars/maven</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <!-- Limitation: A bom file to fix webjars' transitive dependencies -->
            <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
            <artifactId>vaadin-webjars-bom</artifactId>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
            <version>${flow.version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

<dependencies>
    <!-- other dependencies -->

    <!-- the dependency with webjars -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
        <artifactId>flow-components</artifactId>
        <version>${flow.version}</version>
    </dependency>

    <!-- other dependencies -->
</dependncies>
----

== Maven configuration to exclude webjars

If webjar dependencies are not needed, they can be excluded from the project using standard Maven mechanism:
[source,xml]
----
<!-- No webjars == no bom needed and no extra repo needed, but you have to get webjars' files into the build yourself -->
<dependencies>
    <!-- other dependencies -->

    <!-- the dependency with webjars excluded -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
        <artifactId>flow-components</artifactId>
        <version>${flow.version}</version>
        <exclusions>
            <exclusion>
                <groupId>org.webjars.bower</groupId>
                <artifactId>*</artifactId>
            </exclusion>
        </exclusions>
    </dependency>

    <!-- other dependencies -->
</dependncies>

== bower.json configuration

Currently `bower.json` is needed for production mode and in cases when you'd like to be able
to manipulate web component's files before adding them to the application (transpile, minify, check, bundle etc).
It also can be used in developmentMode as a webjars' substitution.

In your `bower.json` file, which is located at `${frontend.working.directory}`, you
need to add the webcomponent dependencies to each desired webcomponent. Here is
an example that adds all supported elements:

[source,json]
----
{
  // [...] other properties
  "dependencies": {
    "polymer": "2.0.2",
    "vaadin-text-field": "1.1.0-alpha2",
    "vaadin-button": "1.0.0",
    "vaadin-checkbox": "1.0.0-alpha1",
    "vaadin-combo-box": "2.0.0",
    "vaadin-form-layout": "1.0.0"
  }
}
----

The full list of Vaadin webcomponents and their latest versions can be found
https://www.webcomponents.org/collection/vaadin/vaadin-core-elements[here].

You only need to add the webcomponents you are going to use in your project.
There's no harm to add webcomponents that you are not going to use at the
server-side, except that the final `war` size will be larger for no reason.

[TIP]
To enable compilation to ES5 (for browsers that lack of ES6 support, such as
  IE11), you need extra configuration, which is described at
  <<../web-components/tutorial-webcomponents-es5#,Serving ES5 Web Components to older browsers with Polymer 2>>

[NOTE]
How to integrate java and web components' files is explained in
<<../web-components/tutorial-webcomponent-basic#,Basic Integration of a Polymer Web Component>>

== Demo and code samples

The Flow components demo at http://flow.app.fi contains examples of
the usage of each supported component, with code samples for common use cases.

You can also download the demo project directly from
https://github.com/vaadin/flow/tree/master/flow-components-parent/demo-flow-components[GitHub]
