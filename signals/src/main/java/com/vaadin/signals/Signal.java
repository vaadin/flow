/**
 * A signal is a reactive value holder with automatic subscription and
 * unsubscription of listeners.
 * <p>
 * Reactivity is based on {@link Signal#effect(Runnable)} callbacks that detect
 * the signals used during invocation. The callback will be run again whenever
 * there's a change to any of the signal instances used in the previous
 * invocation. Detection is based on running {@link #value()}.
 * {@link #untracked(Supplier)} can be used to read the value within an effect
 * without registering a dependency.
 * <p>
 * This interface can be used for creating simple computed signals as a lambda
 * function that uses other signals. This kind of signal is more limited than
 * {@link #computed(Supplier)} since it doesn't cache its value.
