/**
 * Base type for all signals. A signal is a reactive value holder with automatic
 * subscription and unsubscription of listeners.
 * <p>
 * Reactivity is based on {@link #effect(Runnable)} callbacks that detect the
 * signals used during invocation. The callback will be run again whenever
 * there's a change to any of the signal instances used in the previous
 * invocation. Detection is based on running {@link #value()}. {@link #peek()}
 * can be used to read the value within an effect without registering a
 * dependency.
 * <p>
 * A signal may be synchronized across a cluster. In that case, changes to the
 * signal value are only confirmed asynchronously. The regular signal
 * {@link #value()} returns the assumed value based on local modifications
 * whereas {@link #peekConfirmed()} gives access to the confirmed value.
