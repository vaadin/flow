= Including Style Sheets and JavaScript

For styling the application we typically need to include a style sheet. As the framework is creating the initial HTML page for us, we need to tell the framework what style sheets we need. We can do this in our UI class using:

[source,java]
----
@Override
protected void init(VaadinRequest request) {
  // Loaded from "styles.css" in our context root
  getPage().addStyleSheet("styles.css");

  // Loaded from "/root.css" regardless of how our application is deployed
  getPage().addStyleSheet("/root.css");

  // Loaded from "http://example.com/example.css" regardless of where our application is deployed
  getPage().addStyleSheet("http://example.com/example.css");
