= Including Style Sheets

For styling the application you typically need to include a style sheet. The framework is creating the initial HTML page so you need to tell it which style sheets you need. This can be done in your UI class using:

[source,java]
----
@Override
protected void init(VaadinRequest request) {
  // Loaded from "styles.css" in our context root
  getPage().addStyleSheet("styles.css");

  // Loaded from "/root.css" regardless of how our application is deployed
  getPage().addStyleSheet("/root.css");

  // Loaded from "http://example.com/example.css" regardless of where our application is deployed
  getPage().addStyleSheet("http://example.com/example.css");
