Setting up Eclipse to Develop Hummingbird
=========

Import the Project into the Workspace
------------
1. Do *File* -> *Import* -> *General* -> *Existing Maven Project*
1. Select the *hummingbird* folder (where you cloned the project)
1. Ensure all projects are checked
1. Click “finish” to complete the import
1. Disable HTML and XML validation in the workspace to avoid validating Bower dependencies
 1. Eclipse preferences -> *Validation*
 1. Uncheck *Build* for *HTML Syntax Validator*
 1. Uncheck *Build* for *XML Validator*


Note that the first compilation takes a while to finish as Maven downloads dependencies used in the projects.

Compiling the Client Engine
--------
Compile the client engine by executing the eclipse build configuration *Compile ClientEngine* in *hummingbird-client/eclipse*

Set up extra workspace preferences
--------
The following preferences need to be set to keep the project consistent. You need to do this especially to be able to contribute changes to the project.

1. Open *Window* -> *Preferences* (Windows) or *Eclipse* -> *Preferences* (Mac)
1. Go to *General* ->  *Workspace*
 1. Set *Text file encoding* to *UTF-8*
 1. Set *New text file line delimiter* to *Unix*
1. Go to XML -> XML Files -> Editor
 1. Ensure the settings are follows:
<pre><code>Line width: 72
Format comments: true
Join lines: true
Insert whitespace before closing empty end-tags: true
Indent-using spaces: true
Indentation size: 4
</code></pre>

Running tests
=====
The unit tests for the projects can be run using
<pre><code>mvn test</code></pre>

Building a package
=====
The distribution package is built and installed into the local Maven repository by doing

1. mvn install

Running SuperDevMode
=====

To start superDevMode do to the hummingbird-client package and run the maven command:

1. mvn -Psdm clean install gwt:compile gwt:run-codeserver

In eclipse run .launch files from hummingbird-client/eclipse in the order:

1. Compile ClientEngine.launch
2. Super Dev Mode.launch

Navigate to [localhost:9876](localhost:9876) and use the bookmarks to control
dev mode.
