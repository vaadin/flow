## Acknowledgments

- First of all, thanks to @omgovich who created the original `react-colorful` library (MIT License).
- Special thanks @RyanChristian4427 who has rewritten the original library in TypeScript.
- In order to avoid tree-shaking problems, and provide better TS support, `rgbToHex` and `hexToRgb` methods were copied from [@swiftcarrot/color-fns](https://github.com/swiftcarrot/color-fns) (MIT License).
- `hsvToRgb` modified from https://axonflux.com/handy-rgb-to-hsl-and-rgb-to-hsv-color-model-c.
