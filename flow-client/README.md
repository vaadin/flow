# Vaadin Flow Client

This is the client part of flow. It is composed by two parts

   - The flow client protocol, developed in java and compiled with GWT.
   - An npm package that can be used as a JS library to use flow UI in any client app.

## Building the project

`mvn clean package` will do everything, and will leave a `.jar` file
with everything set in the `target` folder.

## Installing the `.jar` 

Run `mvn install` or just `mvn install -DskipTests` 

## Running the npm module

1. Install dependencies

Run either `npm install` or `mvn compile`

2. Compile Code and Run tests

Run either `npm test` or `mvn test`

3. Debug Tests

Run `npm run debug` then point your browser to http://localhost:9000/__intern/ to debug tests.

## Flow Express Build mode

Since Vaadin 24.0, the Flow application can be run in so called Express 
Build mode, where the frontend files are pre-compiled and bundled into {project.root}/src/main/dev-bundle directory. To make your changes in `flow-client` module be included into the Flow test modules, you have to delete this directory, so the Flow will re-compile the bundle and take into account your changes in `flow-client`:
   - remove dev-bundle in the current folder: `rm -rf src/main/dev-bundle`
   - remove dev-bundle in the sub-folders: find . -type d -name dev-bundle -delete
