/**
 * Cleans everything Vaadin-related. Useful if npm fails to run after Vaadin
 * version upgrade. Deletes:
 *
 * * `${frontendDirectory}/generated`
 * * `${generatedTsFolder}`
 * * `node_modules`
 * * `package.json`
 * * `package-lock.json`
 * * `package-lock.yaml` (used by Vaadin 14.2+ pnpm)
 *
 * Doesn't delete `webpack.config.js` since it is intended to contain
 * user-specific code. See https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-gradle-plugin/issues/43
 * for more details.
 *
 * After this task is run, remember to run the `vaadinPrepareFrontend` task to re-create some of the files;
 * the rest of the files will be re-created by Vaadin Servlet, simply by running the application
 * in the development mode.
