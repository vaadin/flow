Assuming that you have already `npm` and `bower` installed in your system, to convert `.html` file to `.js` run the following command:

```
bower install
npm install
node_modules/.bin/modulizer --force --out . --import-style=name
```

Then restore the files that were modified or deleted by modulizer:

```
git checkout package.json flow-component-renderer.html
```

And finally, commit changes made to the `flow-component-renderer.js` file
