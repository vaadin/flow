/**
 * The listener interface for receiving {@link ValidationStatusChangeEvent}
 * events. The classes that are interested in processing validation status
 * changed events of field components should register implementation of this
 * interface via
 * {@link HasValidator#addValidationStatusChangeListener(ValidationStatusChangeListener)}
 * which are called whenever such event is fired by the component.
 * <p>
 * This interface is primarily introduced to enable binding instances subscribe
 * for their own associated field's validation status change events and
 * revalidate after that. However, when all the components implementing
 * {@code HasValidator} interface, implement the correct behaviour for adding
 * and notifying listeners of the current type, other usages are also become
 * possible since the {@link ValidationStatusChangeEvent} payload contains the
 * source {@link com.vaadin.flow.component.HasValue} field and the new
 * validation status, thus for instance fields or buttons in a view can
 * subscribe for each other's validation statuses and enable/disable or clear
 * values, etc. respectively.
 *
 * @since 23.2

 * @see HasValidator
 * @see com.vaadin.flow.data.binder.Binder.BindingBuilderImpl#bind(ValueProvider,
